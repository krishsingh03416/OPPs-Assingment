        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which represent real-world entities. These objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit, promoting modularity and reusability. OOP principles include encapsulation (hiding internal details), inheritance (reusing and extending existing code), polymorphism (using a single interface for different types), and abstraction (simplifying complex systems). Commonly used in languages like Python, Java, and C++, OOP helps organize code, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale applications."
